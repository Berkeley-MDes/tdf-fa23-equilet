### Get your photon2 on the UC Campus IoT network

This tutorial assumes that you have installed Visual Studio Code, alongside the Particle Workbench.
The goal is to get the Mac address of the device you are planning to use for your projects registered with campus IT so that it is recognized and validated.  The steps below will assist you in this process, and are to be performed in sequence.

#### Acquire Mac Address

1. open up vs code

#### Register MAC Address with UC Berkeley for usage with IoT network

1. Log in to the UCB [wifi access portal](https://portal.berkeley.edu/people/wifi_access) (requires CalNet authentication)
1. Scroll down to [Berkeley-IoT Wi-Fi Network Devices] 
1. Click on "Manage devices"
1. Click on "Create New"
1. Enter the Mac Address that you copied in the first step
1. Give this device a name
1. Copy the password that is auto-generated (or generate a new one, and then copy) somewhere safe

#### Connect your Photon2 to the IoT network

1. Navigate to [this link](https://docs.particle.io/tools/developer-tools/configure-wi-fi/)
1. enter your wifi credentials
- Wi-Fi network name: `Berkeley-IoT
- Wi-Fi password: `<the IoT device password>`
